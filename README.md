## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the mobile application.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety throughout the codebase.
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management for efficient handling of data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling components with a utility-first approach.
- **PostgreSQL**: Backend database for managing user and ride data.
- **Google Maps API**: Integrating location services for map rendering and geolocation.

## 📱 Features
